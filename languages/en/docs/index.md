# Material for Mkdocs Insiders YML example

This project is a template of the YML configuration I use for my Material for Mkdocs projects.
It also displays an example layout populated by a guide.


[Read the YML](https://github.com/FlagHunter01/mkdocs-yml/blob/main/languages/en/mkdocs.yml){ .md-button .md-button--primary } [View the layout](https://github.com/FlagHunter01/mkdocs-yml){ .md-button }

Read the [setup guide](guide/setup.md) to get started and take a look at the [useage page](guide/useage.md) to see most of the possible options and their render. 

!!! warning "I use the paid Insiders version"
    This template wont work unless you [sponsor Squidfunk](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/how-to-sponsor/)
